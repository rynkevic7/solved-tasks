#### Array plus array
     
 I'm new to coding and now I want to get the sum of two arrays...actually the sum of all their elements. I'll appreciate for your help.
 
 P.S. Each array includes only integer numbers. Output is a number too.
 
 
 
```javascript

const arrayPlusArray = (arr1, arr2) => arr1.reduce((a, e)=> a + e, 0) + arr2.reduce((a, e)=> a + e, 0);






```
